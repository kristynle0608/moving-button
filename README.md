## Title of Project
Moving Button

## Description
**Moving Button** is a fun project that has two buttons: *Yes* and *No*. If you click on *No*, the button will move to a random position. If you keep clicking on *No*, it will keep moving to a random position on the page (away from your mouse). However, if you click on *Yes*, it will show you a sentence and hide all the buttons.

## Inspiration for this Project
I saw a video on Instagram that shows a similar project to this one. I found it pretty fun to create, so I planned to recreate it at some point. The only difference is the project in the video was done as Python GUI; I recreated it by using HTML, CSS, and JS.
